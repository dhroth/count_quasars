[achievedMedianDepths]
; the code can put vertical lines on the plot to indicate what limiting
; depths were actually achieved for any given filter. To get these lines,
; you need to specify in this section what limiting depth was achieved,
; the name of the survey that achieved this depth (the "label"), the S/N
; of the limiting depth, and the x,y coordinates to put the label at
; 
; this section consists of groups for each filter.
; in each group, there is:
; * a list of achieved depths
; * a list of labels associated with each of those depths
; * the S/N of that achieved depth expressed as an integer number
;   of sigmas (i.e. whether it's a 5\sigma or 10\sigma limiting depth)
; * two lists (x,y) that specify where in the plot to put the label
;
; The units of the (x,y) lists are 
; (x,y)=(limiting magnitude, number of detections) (i.e. the units of the plot)
; These lists must be the same length as the depths and labels arrays
