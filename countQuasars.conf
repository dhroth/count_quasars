[general]

; which survey does the filter correspond to?
; allowable survey names are currently: LSST, DES, WISE, VISTA, HSC, UKIDSS
survey = LSST

; which filter are we trying to detect quasars in
filter = y

; what reddening to use for the simulated quasar SEDs
; there must be simulated SEDs with this reddening
reddening = 0

; what area of the sky to integrate over (in square degrees)
area = 1600

; file containing the joint distribution of the qlf parameters
; (as a tsv of log(phi*), beta, M*
qlfParamsFilename = Willott10_QLF_100bootstraps.bin

; value of k, the dependence of the QLF on redshift
; in Willott et al., k=-0.47
; in Jiang et al., k=-0.7
k = -0.47

[output]

; directory to save output files in
; plots/tables will be saved in a subdirectory called the current git revision
; e.g. <outputDir>/5ef9ab/foo.tbl
; along with a copy of this config file
outputDir = results

; filename for table output
; this string will be formatted with (survey, filter, reddening, redshift)
outFilenameTbl = {}-{}_r{:0<5}_z{:0>6.3f}.tbl

; filename for plot output
; this string will be formatted with (survey, filter, reddening)
outFilenamePlt = {}-{}_r{:0<5}.svg

[sed]

; directory of the SEDs
sedDir = nmSeds

; format specification of the SED files within sedDir. Note this will 
; be evaluated as sedFileFormat.format(reddening, z)
sedFilenameFormat = qm1708_r{:0<5}_ls_z{:0>6.3f}.dat

[integral]

; the z limits determine which SEDs are read in: the program will attempt to
; read one SED for every value of z between zMin and zMax in zStep increments
zMin = 5
zMax = 8
zStep = 0.1

; this determines the range and resolution of the integral over absolute
; magnitude. Only quasars within this M1450 range are counted
M1450Min = -31
M1450Max = -18
M1450Step = 0.1


[cosmology]

; Omega_matter (Omega_Lambda is taken as 1-Omega_Matter)
omegaM = 0.3

; H0 is in km/s/Mpc
H0 = 70 


[plot]

; title of the output plot
plotTitle = 

; minimum y value on the plot
yMin = 1

; maximum y value on the plot
yMax = 1e5

; whether or not to put a grid in the plot
plotGrid = True

; these set the limits on the x axis of the plot
; for each limiting depth between min/maxLimitingDepth, the code
; will calculated how many quasars are detected if that limiting depth
; is achieved
minLimitingDepth = 21
maxLimitingDepth = 24.3

; for each (zCutoff, zColor) tuple specified in these lists, the output plot
; will contain one curve, colored zColor, that describes how many quasars above
; zCutoff will be detected
;zCutoffs = 5.0, 6.0, 6.5, 7, 7.5
;zColors = #0000FF, #4400BB, #880088, #BB0000, #FF0000
zCutoffs = 5.0, 6.0, 6.5, 7
zColors = #0000FF, #880088, #BB0000, #FF0000

; specifies the opacity of the error envelope around each plotted curve
errorEnvelopeAlpha = 0.3

; specifies how many sigma the error envelope extends from the mean
; (so a value of 2 means the envelope will go from mu-2sigma to mu+2sigma)
errorNSigma = 1


[achievedMedianDepths]
; the code can put vertical lines on the plot to indicate what limiting
; depths were actually achieved for any given filter. To get these lines,
; you need to specify in this section what limiting depth was achieved,
; the name of the survey that achieved this depth (the "label"), the S/N
; of the limiting depth, and the x,y coordinates to put the label at
; 
; this section consists of groups for each filter.
; in each group, there is:
; * a list of achieved depths
; * a list of labels associated with each of those depths
; * the S/N of that achieved depth expressed as an integer number
;   of sigmas (i.e. whether it's a 5\sigma or 10\sigma limiting depth)
; * two lists (x,y) that specify where in the plot to put the label
;
; The units of the (x,y) lists are 
; (x,y)=(limiting magnitude, number of detections) (i.e. the units of the plot)
; These lists must be the same length as the depths and labels arrays
